# AWSEC2ELBCrossZoneLB
On-demand environments with IaC for client demo's & DEV/Test Enviornments. Cross zone Load Balancing with Terraform. Deploy a Set of EC2 Instances behind an ALB. This Terraform code can very easily be extended for more complex enterprise grade infrastructure creation.
* Terraform is used to create a sample, reusable infrastructure which can be created and destroyed as many times as possible. Below is the architecture which would be created entirely through Terraform in AWS. <br/>
* **Good quality Cloud Architecture diagrams can be done easily in draw.io. It is a cloud based tool with minimal hassel.** <br/>
